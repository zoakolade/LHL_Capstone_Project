# LHL_Capstone_Project - Telecome provider customer churn 
This is my final project for my LHL Diploma program.

# Goal 
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive ML model that will assist in determing the various features affecting
churn in the telecommunication industry using the available dataset. This model can therefore be applied to similar situtions in the future.

# Data
Data from Kaggle.com, obtained under a free public license, is accessible in the "Telecom churn.csv" directory of this repository.

# Conclusion
The key factors that significantly influence the deactivation of customers telecom facilities are data_used, pincode, estimated_salary, date_of_registration, call_made and age.

High Training and Testing Accuracies: Both the model achieved a moderate accuracy score the training data, indicating a good fit to the training instances. Additionally, the model's accuracy score over 50% on the testing data suggests its ability to generalize well to unseen instances.

F1 Score, Recall, and Precision: The model achieved average F1 score, recall, and precision values. This indicates that the model has a ability to correctly identify positive cases while minimizing false positives and maximizing true positives.
It suggests that the model is able to distinguish between positive and negative instances with a relatively high degree of accuracy.

Overall Model Performance: The model demonstrates a good performance across multiple evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in making accurate predictions and capturing the desired outcomes.

# Challenges and Future Goals
Data sourcing could be a challenge when doing industry analysis 
Model can still be improved and deployed for various situations
Applying other predictive models in the future will be great for deep learning.
